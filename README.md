# Mask-vs-NoMask-Classification
Minor Course Project, Pattern Recognition &amp; Machine Learning (CSL2050), developed under the guidance of Dr. Richa Singh

## Data
- [Google Drive link]()

## Loading data?
Import Data from Resource given. It has train features, train label and test labels. For RF, MLP , KNN , SVM we can directly use these features (latent vectors) generated by extrating features from images. For CNN we use images available in dataset.

## How to Execute?
The collab notebook is written sequentially. Just run the blocks one by one. Some block may even take few hours to run.

## Structure of Code
The code is divided into multiple selection. 
- A. Dependencies & Data Loading (imoprt neccesary libraries and data)
- B. Latent Vector creation (Image to Latent Vector by feature extration.)
- C. Data Preprocessing(For images make training testing set by ImageDataGenerator. For latent vector split into train/test , standardized data and reduced dimentioned data.)
- D. RF, MLP , KNN , SVM (Three Classification model. Each model has 3 set {1. Normal Data, 2. Standardized Data , 3. Feature selection})
- E. CNN (A three layer CNN model for image classification)
