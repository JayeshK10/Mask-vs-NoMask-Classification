# Mask-vs-NoMask-Classification
Minor Course Project, Pattern Recognition &amp; Machine Learning (CSL2050), developed under the guidance of Dr. Richa Singh

## Data
- [Google Drive link]()

## Loading data?
Import Data from Resource given. It has train features, train label and test labels. For RF, MLP , KNN , SVM we can directly use these features (latent vectors) generated by extracting features from images. For CNN we use images available in dataset.

## How to Execute?
The collab notebook is written sequentially. Just run the blocks one by one. Some block may even take few hours to run.

## Structure of Code
The code is divided into multiple selection. 
- Dependencies & Data Loading (import neccesary libraries and data).
- Latent Vector creation (Image to Latent Vector by feature extraction).
- Data Preprocessing (For images, make training testing set by ImageDataGenerator. For latent vector split into train/test, standardized data and reduced dimensioned data).
- RF, MLP, KNN, SVM (Three Classification models. Each model has 3 set {1. Normal Data, 2. Standardized Data , 3. Feature selection}).
- CNN (A three layer CNN model for image classification).
